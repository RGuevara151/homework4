<h3><card-title>halloween Slash Cake</card-title></h3>
<p>
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line the bases of two 20cm sandwich tins. Melt the butter in a pan, then remove from the heat and beat in the oil, milk, yogurt, vanilla and eggs. Whisk the dry ingredients together with a large pinch of salt, squishing any lumps of sugar with your fingers. Tip the wet ingredients into the dry, then whisk until smooth.
</p>
<p>
STEP 2
Divide the batter between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins on the same shelf of the oven until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool for 10 mins in the tins, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.
</p>
<p>
STEP 3
To make the buttercream, beat together the sugar, butter and a few drops of the red food colouring. Add 2-3 tbsp of boiling water if needed to soften the mixture, until you end up with a smooth, spreadable icing.
</p>
<p>
STEP 4
Trim the cakes flat if needed, then halve each through the middle using a large serrated knife. Put one cake layer on a board or plate, spread over a thin layer of the buttercream and dot over a third of the jam. Top with another cake layer and repeat with the buttercream, jam and cake, finishing with a layer of cake. Use most of the remaining buttercream to ice the cake all over, reserving a small amount.
</p>
<p>
STEP 5
Roll the fondant icing out on a surface dusted with icing sugar until large enough to cover the top and sides of the cake. Carefully lift it up onto the cake and smooth down to help it to stick. Use a sharp knife to cut slashes into the icing, then drizzle a little of the reserved buttercream mixed with some water into each to look like blood.

                        <p>STEP 1
                        Break the Madeira cake and cookies into the bowl of a food processor, pour in the melted milk chocolate and whizz to combine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        STEP 2
                        Tip the mixture into a bowl, then use your hands to roll into about 10 walnut-sized balls. Chill for 2 hrs until really firm.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        STEP 3
                        Push a skewer into each ball, then carefully spoon the white chocolate over the cake balls to completely cover. Stand the cake pops in the pumpkin, then press a Smartie onto the surface while wet. Chill again until the chocolate has set. Before serving, using the icing pens, add a pupil to each Smartie and wiggly red veins to the eyeballs.</p>

                        <p>
                        STEP 1
                        Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Butter a deep 22cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line with baking parchment. Wrap the base and side of the tin with three layers of cling film, followed by three layers of foil (this helps keep it waterproof during baking). Fold a clean tea towel and put it in the base of a large roasting tin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        STEP 2
                        Blitz the biscuits to crumbs in a food processor. Add the melted butter and pulse to coat the crumbs. Tip the mixture into the prepared cake tin, spreading up to the side and pressing down with the back of a spoon. Bake for 10 mins. Remove from the oven, brush with the egg white and bake for another 3 mins (this will help stop the base from becoming soggy).
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        STEP 3
                        To make the filling, put the soft cheese in a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat with an electric whisk or the mixer until loosened. Add the pumpkin purée, sugar and flour and beat again until combined. With the motor running, gradually add the eggs and egg yolk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Pour the filling over the baked biscuit base, then sit the cake tin on the tea towel in the roasting tin. Pour a kettleful of just-boiled water into the roasting tin so the water comes halfway up the side of the cake tin.
                    </p> 
                    <p>  
                        STEP 4
                        Bake for 10 mins, then reduce the oven temperature to 110C/90C fan/gas ¼. Bake for a further 1 hr 30 mins until the cheesecake is set with just a slight wobble in the middle when you gently shake the tin. Turn off the oven, then open the oven door slightly and leave the cheesecake to cool inside for 2 hrs until completely cool. Remove from the oven and chill overnight.
                    </p> 
                    <p> 
                        STEP 5
                        Carefully remove the cold cheesecake from the tin and transfer to a cake stand or serving plate. Whip the cream to soft peaks using an electric whisk, and spoon in big dollops over the cheesecake. Dust with a little cinnamon or pumpkin spice, sprinkle over the chopped pecans and drizzle with the caramel sauce before serving.

                        <p>
                        STEP 1
                        Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 24 x 20cm brownie tin with baking parchment. Melt the butter and dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a small pan of just simmering water. Stir until completely smooth, then leave to cool for 10 mins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        STEP 2
                      Beat the eggs and sugar with an electric whisk until thick and pale – the mixture should double in volume and leave a trail when the beaters are lifted. Pour the cooled dark chocolate mixture around the edge of the bowl. Sift over the flour and cocoa, add the milk chocolate, and gently fold everything together with a spatula or large metal spoon. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                        STEP 3
                        Meanwhile, make the ‘eyeballs’. Melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl over the pan of just simmering water. Stir until smooth. Dip each cookie into the chocolate to cover one side. Stick a sugar-coated chocolate in the centre of each, then leave to set. When the chocolate is fully dry, pipe a pupil and red veins onto each eyeball using the icing pens.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        STEP 4
                        Remove the traybake from the oven, and immediately push the eyeballs into the surface in even rows – do this gently, so they’re just pushed in slightly. Leave to cool completely. Cut into 12 squares.
